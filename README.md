The rising incidence of ischemic stroke poses a significant threat to health and well-being. To lessen the damage that strokes cause, early detection and intervention are essential. Machine-learning-based systems have proven effective in predicting and reducing the impact of various diseases, including strokes. In this research, a dataset with 5026 data points and 11 features related to strokes was used to train three machine learning boosting models: an XGBoost, an AdaBoost, and a Gradient Boosting Classifier. Among these, AdaBoost models performed the best, with an accuracy rate of 97.73%. So, the most accurate model, AdaBoost, was chosen for forecasting stroke risk. To make the system accessible, a hosted web application and a mobile app were developed. This study has the potential to significantly improve the medical system's ability to prevent and mitigate the damage caused by ischemic strokes through early prediction and intervention.
